# Algorithms_Comparison_CIA1
1. The shortest path from source node to all possible nodes with PRIMS, KRISKALS, DIJKSTRA'S algorithms using C/C++/Python/Java. Give a justification for the choice of the programming language.

2. Give a note of comparison regarding the performance of the algorithms. If you feel that any of the algorithms fail to find any of the required paths, give justification for the same.
