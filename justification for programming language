In the above programs, I used " C " language. The reasons:
1)I am comfortable coding data structures and algorithms using C.
2)C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. 
It also allows free movement of data across these functions.
3)As a middle-level language, C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, 
such as scripting for software applications etc.
