This folder contains code for Dijkstra's algorithm.(general code as this can't be used in this case)
For the given directed graph which contains negative weights, Dijsktra's algorithm will not produce the accurate results.
Conditions for optimal execution of Dijkstra's Algorithm:
1)Can be directed
2)Weights have to be non-negative(zero or positive).

Failed in every instance where a negative number was used.


Hence, it is not recommended to use this algorithm for negatively weighted graphs.
